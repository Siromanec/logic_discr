# logic_discr
## This project is about simulating computers!
  We explored how we can build computer basically from scratch using only basic elements. All we need is some logic gates and some electricity - and we have something similar to a primitive calculator - ALU. The project shows how we can transform logical discrete expression onto a simulated board and behave like a computer on low level.

## requirements:
  `tkinter, customtkinter, pillow`
  
## usage:
```
python logic_discr.py
```
Then the app appears and you have a canvas and buttons.

Click on element to select it.

To add the element on the board click anywhere on the canvas (grey area)

To connect elements select "Connect" on the bottom right corner and click on two pins (small circles) you want to connect
